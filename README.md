## Business requirements:

#### Story 1: As a employee I need to find employee information about me or my collegues.
> What is *John*'s **phone number**?

>	Can you help me with *George*'s **contract number**?

>	My **phone number**
		
#### Story 2: As a employee I need to find which collegues match with a specific employee information value.
> Who has the **phone number** *+40726372172*?

> Which collegue has *ABC351263* **contract number**?

**Employee information** are: *phone, email, department, contract number, contract start date, dismissal days, position*

## Implementation:
- you can find LUIS model in **LuisModel** folder
- I tried to implement both stories with a single intent *"HCM_EmployeeInfo"*.
- **employeeInfoType** entity is a list entity with a code as a normalized value. The items are the employee information (phone, email, ... etc)
  - **employeeInfoType** entity has two roles: **needValue** and **needPerson**.
  - **needPerson** indicates that the utterance is referred to the first story.
  - **needValue** indicates that the utterance is referred to the second story.
- **employeeInfoValue** entity is a simple entity that indicates the value of an employee information (the value of the phone, the value of the contract number, ...etc)
- **my** entity is a simple entity that indicates the user need to find his own information
- **person** entity is a simple entity that indicates the person name

## Results of the implementation:
- in "Tests\Input" you can find a collection of test cases that contains in a JSON format a collection of utterances with expected top intent and entities
- in "Tests\Output" you can find the result of the above tests. The results were generated by a console app that can be found in "LuisTestClient"

## The problems are obvious:
- Top score intent was not matched
- Some entities and roles have not beed identified
